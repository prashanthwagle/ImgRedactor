The editing options are

2. Clear the canvas
3. Tools: Pointer (to move around the image), Spray (to spray paint on the image), Erase (to erase the sprayed paint)
4. Spray Size: To adjust the extent of the spray

6. Save project: To save the contents of the canvas


## Best Practices
1. Made sure that the elements are well laid out
2. Handled all exceptions
3. Ensured that the C# coding guidelines are followed in naming variables, declaring nullable types etc.
4. Documented the functionality using XML documentation comments
5. Ensured optimal performance
