# SprayPaintApp

## An application built using C# WPF which enables you to spray paint and edit on images

## Technical Features
1.	The user would be able to select and load an image: JPG, PNG, BMP etc.
2.	The user would be able to spray paint over an image using a mouse
3.	The user would be able to change the color and density of the paint
4.	The user can erase some or all of the spray paint using mouse
5.	The user will be able to save changes to a new image
6.	The application state will be persistent i.e., the user can close an unfinished project and reopen it to restore the previous state; the original file would be unaltered.

## Functionality
As you see in the screenshot, there is a canvas on the right hand side and the various editing option on the right
The editing options are
1. Load an image file into the Canvas
2. Clear the canvas
3. Tools: Pointer (to move around the image), Spray (to spray paint on the image), Erase (to erase the sprayed paint)
4. Spray Size: To adjust the extent of the spray
5. Spray Color: To choose various colors for the spray
6. Save project: To save the contents of the canvas


## Best Practices
1. Made sure that the elements are well laid out
2. Handled all exceptions
3. Ensured that the C# coding guidelines are followed in naming variables, declaring nullable types etc.
4. Documented the functionality using XML documentation comments
5. Ensured optimal performance
